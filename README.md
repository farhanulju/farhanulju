# üëã Hello there! I'm Farhanul

## About Me

I'm a business strategist passionate about leveraging technology to drive efficiency and innovation. While my background isn't in traditional development, I thrive on understanding and utilizing tech to build effective digital solutions and optimize business processes.

### What I'm Currently Up To

I'm currently a **Product Manager at Bevy Commerce Inc**, where I'm responsible for managing existing product lines and spearheading the development of new products tailored for our enterprise clients. This involves deep collaboration with engineering, design, and sales teams to bring impactful solutions to market.

Recently, I've also been exploring rapid prototyping using **Lovable** to significantly reduce the time to market for new product concepts. This allows for quick iteration and validation, ensuring we build the right solutions efficiently.

On the personal front, I've launched a new project: [Alumni Connect Universe](https://alumni-connect-universe.vercel.app/) ‚Äì a platform built to foster connection and networking among IBA JU alumni.

My experience in project management now includes **Clickup**, which I've integrated into my workflow to enhance organization and collaboration.

### My Ventures

#### CubeNation ([https://cubenationshop.com](https://cubenationshop.com))

As the leader of CubeNation, a prominent Bangladeshi hub for puzzle enthusiasts and speedcubers, I focus on data-driven decision-making to optimize our supply chain and enhance customer experience. My efforts led to a **17% growth in our retail pipeline in 2024**. Furthermore, I served as the product owner for CubeNation's custom NextJS-based website, launched in 2023. This strategic upgrade resulted in a **14.3% revenue improvement in 2023**, with continued growth to date.

### Notable Projects

#### [IBA-BBA29 CV](https://bba29.iba-ju.edu.bd/) (Closed-source)

Led the development of a digital CV website for the graduating batch of IBA-JU. Built with NextJS and MongoDB, the site utilizes ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration) and SSG (Server-Side Generation) to achieve loading times of under 500ms.
